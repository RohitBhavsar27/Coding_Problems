//-1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5, 3, 7, 5, 11, 8, 13, 13, 17â€¦..
//-This series is a mixture of 2 series fail the odd terms in this series form a Fibonacci series and all the even terms are the prime numbers in ascending order
//-Write a program to find the Nth term in this series
//-The value N in a positive integer that should be read from mm. The Nth term that is calculated by the program should be written to STDOUT Otherthan the value 
//of Nth term , no other characters / string or message should be written to STDOUT.
//-For example, when N:14, the 14th term in the series is 17 So only the value 17 should be printed to STDOUT
